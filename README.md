# Welcome to RandomThings Isolated Infra!	
This guide is here to teach you how to use Kasm and the randomthings platform!

## Kasm Navigation
In order to upload files for testing, just head to the top of kasm and hit the server icon. That way, you will get 
a full index of all system files with the option to upload or delete files. Git is also provided so you may 
`git push` any completed projects to your repository if you choose.

## Cosmos SSO
If at any time you wish to use or delete another instance, you are welcome to head back to the
[Cosmos SSO](https://caen.bobignou.red) the sso dashboard also gives users acess to Constilation
and Nextcloud for remote access and file storage.
